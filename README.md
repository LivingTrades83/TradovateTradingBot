# TradovateTradingBot
Automated trading bot that won't ever make you money

I wanted to automate a way to make trades for me while I wasn't staring at my computer for multiple hours a day, and since I was only trading based on basic candlestick patterns, this task wasn't going to be that hard. I used the broker, Tradovate, so if you ever want to try this out then you'd need the same broker. I didn't want to pay for the API so this automation is based around computer screenshots.
